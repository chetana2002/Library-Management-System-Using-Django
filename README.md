# Library-Management-System-Using-Django
In the era of modernization, everything is accomplished or thought to be accessed through the internet so that do not need to waste time and face any inconvenience. With the increase of the number of students in Universities, maintaining a library using the old management methods is too complex and time-consuming and hardly possible to adapt to the development of times. The manual process of keeping student records, book records, account details, managing employees is very difficult. There are various problems also faced by the student in the library such as finding any particular book, information whether the book is available or not, for what time this book will be available, searching of books using ISBN number etc. To eliminate this manual system, a library management system has been developed. The Library Management System will handle all the current issues faced by the students and by its admin personal.
